An Energy System Model covers at least two Sector --> Elec Only is not ESOM! Zitat Constantin

- Sector only Model has boundaries
- Sector coupling also looks at where Energy is best used.

P2H, P2M, P2G, DU (PowertoHeat, PowertoMobility, PowertoGas, Direct Use)

Sectors are always described in input/output relations with efficiency, so pretty easy to describe. Abllity in urbs exists in its basics, but no in depth equation for Electrolyses etc. For next paper bring urbs to
a state where it maps the most Important Sectors and also Different Energy Demands, not Elec only, aso Heat, hydrogen for industry etc.

A model does not predict anything, it shows Pathways! Ways to the future, not a prediction. We can not describe anything, we can though create robust results for short-term. 

Transmision increase rate done as % , Scenario sets that, for example 5% per year. Invest in â‚¬/GW/km. 


AD MODEL URBS-EXTENSION:
  - comparing BESS from urbs to GENESYS-Mod schows 50% lower Bess installed in our model. Propably due to way lower Energy Demand and strict linkage to solarPV expansion in urbs!!
